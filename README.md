# Minecraft AFK Bot

This Node.js bot automatically joins my Aternos Minecraft server (cracked, PaperMC 1.21.1) to keep it online 24/7.

## Features
- Anti-AFK movement (walks & jumps)
- Reconnects if kicked
- Can be hosted on Replit + UptimeRobot

## How to Use
1. Replace `host` with your Aternos IP
2. Replace `username` with a bot name
3. Run using `node index.js`
